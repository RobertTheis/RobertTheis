- 👋 Hello World, I’m @RobertTheis

- 👀 I’m interested in learning new stuff, especially about AI technology, social networking, 
      the effects of technology and software in businesses and making the world a better place. 
      Got into informatics as a kid, never pursued it until now, and have a lot to learn so... Bring it on! :D
      
- 🌱 I’m currently studying business informatics in Bamberg, Germany. That's fun! Also learning how to do this thing called "coding" in several languages. 
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to find inspiration and gather experience.
